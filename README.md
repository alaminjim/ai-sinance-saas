* **Manual entry:** Users add transactions manually with title, amount, date, category, and description.
* **Monthly reports:** The system aggregates transactions by month and sends an email summary automatically.
* **CSV workflows:** Import a CSV to bulk-create transactions; export monthly or yearly data as CSV.
